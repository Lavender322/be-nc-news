## Local Development Setup

To run this project locally, you will need to configure environment variables to connect to two PostgreSQL databases. This involves creating two environment files: **.env.test** and **.env.development** at the top level of this folder. Into each, add `PGDATABASE=`, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names).
